# Soil 'N Sunshine
Website for an app that connects local farmers to local consumers

The current plan is to gather (scrape) information from Local Farm Finder (an app from Barn2Door) and give it a new interface.

Local Farm Finder currently allows users to enter a location and find local farms, they then have to go to individual farmer's websites and see what they offer

Our goal here is to give an easy to navigate front end to users.

Our scope current as of 21 March 2022:
1. create a website
2. have homepage, about, and shop
3. have pages within the shop page that shows specific products
4. get users location
5. display products
6. show who sells them
7. show delivery schedules
8. keep customer's information
9. create/capture reviews for individual items
10. create/capture reviews for farmers overall
11. implement recipe integration w/ cart

Let's get after it!
